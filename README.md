# music-wallet-modules
Repository to fetch preinstalled `node_modules` for Windows and MacOS for music-builder

Is always easier to just switch `node_modules` folder with newer version for update, instead of overwriting files. This will make sure no any old files remaining. Git will solve changes automatically.
